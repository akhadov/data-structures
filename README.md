# C# Data Structures

## Introduction

Welcome to the C# Data Structures repository! This comprehensive guide explores the fundamental data structures implemented in C#, providing clear explanations, examples, and best practices for their use.

This repository divides data structures into the following categories:

### 1. Built-in Data Structures
#### 1.1 Array-Based Collections
- Arrays (Single and Multi-dimensional)
- Lists
  - List<T>
  - ArrayList (Legacy)
  - ReadOnlyCollection<T>

#### 1.2 Key-Value Collections
- Dictionaries
  - Dictionary<TKey, TValue>
  - SortedDictionary<TKey, TValue>
  - ConcurrentDictionary<TKey, TValue>
- HashSets
  - HashSet<T>
  - SortedSet<T>

#### 1.3 FIFO/LIFO Collections
- Queues
  - Queue<T>
  - ConcurrentQueue<T>
  - PriorityQueue<TElement, TPriority>
- Stacks
  - Stack<T>
  - ConcurrentStack<T>

### 2. Linear Data Structures
#### 2.1 Linked Lists
- Singly Linked Lists
  - Implementation
  - Operations
- Doubly Linked Lists
  - LinkedList<T>
  - Custom Implementation
- Circular Linked Lists
  - Singly Circular
  - Doubly Circular

#### 2.2 Advanced Linear Structures
- Skip Lists
  - Probabilistic Data Structure
  - Implementation

- Undirected Graphs
- Weighted Graphs
- Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)

#### 4.3 Graph Operations

- Minimum Spanning Trees
- Shortest Path Algorithms

### 5. Advanced Data Structures
#### 5.1 Heaps and Priority Structures
- Priority Queues
- Binary Heaps
  - Min Heap
  - Max Heap
- Fibonacci Heaps

#### 5.2 Probabilistic Data Structures
